# Critter-Hunt

Critter Hunt is an app that allows you to network with friends and find all sorts of animals around campus and share the encounter with others through taking pictures and posting them. The application will contain the geolocation of these animals which users can use to find the animals. If many critters are found around the same area they will create “hubs”. Points will be awarded to users for taking pictures of critters and posting them. If a user finds the complete set of animals on a created hub they will get extra points. Main page of the app will be the camera similar to Snapchat. A user can hold different posts, add, delete, search and update them. Cool app.
